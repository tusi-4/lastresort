            <h2>Papa Roach</h2>
            <p class="lyrics">
                Cut my life into pieces<br>
                This is my last resort<br>
                Suffocation<br>
                No breathing<br>
                Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding<br><br>
                This is my last resort<br><br>
                Cut my life into pieces<br>
                I've reached my last resort<br>
                Suffocation<br>
                No breathing<br>
                Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding<br>
                Do you even care if I die bleeding?<br>
                Would it be wrong?<br>
                Would it be right?<br>
                If I took my life tonight<br>
                Chances are that I might<br>
                Mutilation out of sight<br>
                And I'm contemplating suicide<br><br>
                'Cause I'm losing my sight<br>
                Losing my mind<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br>
                Losing my sight<br>
                Losing my mind<br>
                Suffocation<br>
                No breathing<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br><br>
                I never realized I was spread too thin<br>
                'Till it was too late<br>
                And I was empty within<br>
                Hungry!<br>
                Feeding on chaos and living in sin<br>
                Downward spiral<br>
                Where do I begin?<br>
                It all started when I lost my Mother<br>
                No love for myself<br>
                And no love from another<br>
                Searching!<br>
                To find a lover on a higher level<br>
                Finding nothing but questions and devils<br><br>
                'Cause I'm losing my sight<br>
                Losing my mind<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br>
                Losing my sight<br>
                Losing my mind<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br>
                Nothing is alright<br>
                Nothing is fine<br>
                I'm running, and I'm cryin'<br>
                I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin, I'm cryin'<br><br>
                I can't go on living this way<br><br>
                Cut my life into pieces<br>
                This is my last resort!<br>
                Suffocation, no breathing<br>
                Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding<br>
                Would it be wrong? Would it be right?<br>
                If I took my life tonight<br>
                Chances are that I might<br>
                Mutilation out of sight<br>
                And I'm contemplating suicide<br><br>
                'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br>
                Losing my sight, losing my mind<br>
                Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine<br>
                Nothing's alright, nothing is fine<br>
                I'm running and I'm crying<br>
                I can't go on living this way!<br><br>
                Can't go on<br>
                Living this way!<br>
                Nothing's all right!<br>
